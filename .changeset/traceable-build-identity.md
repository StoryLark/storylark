Traceable build identity. The app version shown in Settings/About is now storylark-core's real npm version (the hand-bumped APP_VERSION counter is gone), and About gains a "Version & build" section listing the version of every installed storylark-* package plus the solution build's git commit, build time, and brand. The Vite preset injects this at build time via `virtual:storylark-build`. RELEASE-NOTES.md headings are now keyed to the same version number. worker/pipeline: expose `./package.json` in exports so build tooling can read their versions.

# storylark-pipeline

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- [`20d2df7`](https://github.com/StoryLark/storylark/commit/20d2df751b4c4c458aa766731fe0a630fbe8dc26) Thanks [@kristopherjturner](https://github.com/kristopherjturner)! - Narrator voice picker — a library can now offer multiple narrator voices.

  - Pipeline: `brand.json` `tts.voices` lists every voice the library ships;
    extras publish as per-voice audio + word-timing tracks (with automatic
    backfill for already-published chapters), and the manifest carries a
    `voices` map of display names.
  - App: a "Narrator" picker appears in Settings whenever the library publishes
    2+ voices; the choice is synced across devices, applies on the next play,
    and downloads keep the chosen narrator available offline. Older manifests
    without voices keep working unchanged.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [`67e24f6`](https://github.com/StoryLark/storylark/commit/67e24f685dcaa7beb9e0f89a85fb321fe8ebce54) Thanks [@kristopherjturner](https://github.com/kristopherjturner)! - First packaged release of the StoryLark engine — the three-layer model ships as
  installable packages:

  - `storylark-core` — the read-along PWA engine plus the `defineStorylarkConfig`
    Vite preset. A site is now `index.html` + a 3-line `entry.ts` + a 5-line
    `vite.config.ts` + a brand folder; theme, fonts, and config arrive through
    virtual modules, so `npm update storylark-core` can never touch a site's
    theme or presentation.
  - `storylark-worker` — the Hono API Worker, importable from a site's worker
    entry, with D1 migrations shipped under `./migrations`.
  - `storylark-pipeline` — the publish pipeline as a site-agnostic CLI
    (`storylark-publish`) with an injected, site-owned content parser; publish
    state lives in the site repo under `.storylark/`.

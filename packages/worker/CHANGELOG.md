# storylark-worker

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- [`2f3bac8`](https://github.com/StoryLark/storylark/commit/2f3bac8eeac6ef025be2bff9b4f0d963096a2001) Thanks [@kristopherjturner](https://github.com/kristopherjturner)! - Self-update and admin portal (AB#7403, AB#7404). A new `/admin` screen
  (admin-key gated, key held in localStorage) shows the running engine
  version against the latest published release, with an "Install update"
  button that dispatches the site's own `self-update.yml` GitHub Actions
  workflow — the click is the approval; nothing updates without it, and the
  updater can only ever touch pinned engine versions, never a brand's theme
  or presentation config. The portal also has a status view (library size,
  push subscriber count) and a text story-upload form that commits markdown
  via the GitHub Contents API and dispatches `publish.yml`, running the
  real, unchanged publish pipeline rather than a second copy of its logic.

  New worker routes: `GET /api/admin/status`, `GET /api/admin/update-status`,
  `POST /api/admin/update-install`, `POST /api/admin/publish-story`. A
  scheduled check (Cloudflare Cron Trigger / Azure interval) can also email
  the operator proactively when RESEND_API_KEY and ADMIN_EMAIL are set — all
  optional, everything degrades cleanly without these secrets configured.

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- [`ccb4899`](https://github.com/StoryLark/storylark/commit/ccb489966335099c7f176c14934443885fed9b40) Thanks [@kristopherjturner](https://github.com/kristopherjturner)! - Database access now goes through a platform-agnostic Database interface
  (`Database` + `ConflictInsert` in `src/db/types.ts`) instead of directly
  against Cloudflare D1. The Cloudflare driver (`src/db/d1.ts`) is a zero-cost
  identity wrapper — no behavior change for existing D1 deployments. A new
  Postgres driver (`src/db/postgres.ts`) covers Azure Database for PostgreSQL
  and AWS RDS/Aurora with one implementation, translating `?` placeholders
  positionally and using `citext` for case-insensitive email/username lookups.

  The three `INSERT OR IGNORE` call sites move to a portable `insertIgnore()`
  helper — the only genuinely dialect-specific SQL, implemented once per
  driver.

  The package now also exports a raw `app` (the Hono instance with no
  Cloudflare-specific wrapping) alongside the existing Cloudflare-only default
  export, for platform entries that bind `env.DB` to a driver directly
  (`platforms/azure/server.mjs`).

  Migrations gained a Postgres-dialect mirror: `migrations-postgres/*.sql` plus
  `migrate-postgres.mjs`, the Postgres equivalent of
  `wrangler d1 migrations apply`.

## 0.4.0

### Patch Changes

- [`95e38e0`](https://github.com/StoryLark/storylark/commit/95e38e00711cb3ffb8f86dad44777c1426d34e16) Thanks [@kristopherjturner](https://github.com/kristopherjturner)! - Traceable build identity. The app version shown in Settings/About is now storylark-core's real npm version (the hand-bumped APP_VERSION counter is gone), and About gains a "Version & build" section listing the version of every installed storylark-\* package plus the solution build's git commit, build time, and brand. The Vite preset injects this at build time via `virtual:storylark-build`. RELEASE-NOTES.md headings are now keyed to the same version number. worker/pipeline: expose `./package.json` in exports so build tooling can read their versions.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [`67e24f6`](https://github.com/StoryLark/storylark/commit/67e24f685dcaa7beb9e0f89a85fb321fe8ebce54) Thanks [@kristopherjturner](https://github.com/kristopherjturner)! - First packaged release of the StoryLark engine — the three-layer model ships as
  installable packages:

  - `storylark-core` — the read-along PWA engine plus the `defineStorylarkConfig`
    Vite preset. A site is now `index.html` + a 3-line `entry.ts` + a 5-line
    `vite.config.ts` + a brand folder; theme, fonts, and config arrive through
    virtual modules, so `npm update storylark-core` can never touch a site's
    theme or presentation.
  - `storylark-worker` — the Hono API Worker, importable from a site's worker
    entry, with D1 migrations shipped under `./migrations`.
  - `storylark-pipeline` — the publish pipeline as a site-agnostic CLI
    (`storylark-publish`) with an injected, site-owned content parser; publish
    state lives in the site repo under `.storylark/`.
